/**
 * Allowed transitions for an order's lifecycle.
 *
 * The state machine deliberately does NOT branch on direction
 * (eth->xlm vs xlm->eth) — both directions follow the same conceptual
 * stages:
 *
 *   announced
 *     └─ source side locked → src_locked
 *           └─ destination side locked by resolver → dst_locked
 *                 └─ preimage revealed on either side → secret_revealed
 *                       └─ both sides settled → completed
 *
 *   At any point an order can transition to `refunded` (timelock
 *   expired and the user/cleaner called refund) or `failed` (we
 *   detected a fatal condition we cannot recover from).
 *   `expired` is a soft state used by the UI to show "this order's
 *   timelock has passed without a refund yet".
