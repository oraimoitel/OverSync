# Deployment

Step-by-step instructions for deploying OverSync v2 to testnet or
mainnet. Replaces the previous `MAINNET_SETUP.md` /
`MAINNET_SETUP_UPDATED.md` / `RATE_LIMIT_FIX.md` documents, which
contained inconsistencies the SCF #40 panel flagged.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.5+ (required for built-in `node:sqlite`)
- pnpm 9+
- Rust stable + `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
- Stellar CLI 22.x (`cargo install --locked stellar-cli`)
- A funded Ethereum deployer key (Sepolia or mainnet)
- A funded Stellar account (Soroban testnet or public)

## 1. Copy and fill in the env file

```bash
cp env.example .env
$EDITOR .env
```

At minimum, set:

```
NETWORK_MODE=testnet
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/<key>
SOROBAN_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=<key>
```

You will fill in the deployed contract addresses later.

## 2. Deploy the Soroban contracts

```bash
cd soroban
stellar keys generate --global --network testnet deployer
stellar keys fund deployer --network testnet
./scripts/deploy.sh testnet deployer
```

This:

1. Builds both WASM artefacts (`oversync_htlc.wasm` and
   `oversync_resolver_registry.wasm`).
2. Deploys + initialises them on the chosen network.
3. Links the HTLC to the registry via `set_resolver_registry`.
4. Writes contract ids to `deployments.<network>.json`.

Copy the contract ids into `.env`:

```
SOROBAN_HTLC_TESTNET=C...
SOROBAN_RESOLVER_REGISTRY_TESTNET=C...
```

## 3. Deploy the Ethereum contracts

The deploy script requires a stake asset (an ERC20 used for resolver
staking). On testnet you can use any test ERC20; on mainnet pick a
stable token such as USDC.

```bash
cd contracts
V2_STAKE_ASSET=0x...                  # ERC20 address
V2_MIN_STAKE=100000000000000000000    # 100 tokens (assuming 18 dp)
V2_MIN_SAFETY_DEPOSIT=0
RELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...

pnpm exec hardhat run scripts/v2/deploy.ts --network sepolia
```

This deploys `ResolverRegistry` and `HTLCEscrow` and appends the
addresses to `deployments.sepolia.json`. Copy them into `.env`:

```
ETH_HTLC_ESCROW_TESTNET=0x...
ETH_RESOLVER_REGISTRY_TESTNET=0x...
```

## 4. Start the coordinator

```bash
cd coordinator
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

By default the coordinator listens on `:3001` and writes its cache to
`./oversync.db`. For production swap to a Postgres connection string
via `DATABASE_URL`.

## 5. (Optional) Start a resolver

See [`RESOLVERS.md`](RESOLVERS.md). The short version:

```bash
cd resolver
pnpm install
pnpm build
node dist/index.js register   # stake into the registry
node dist/index.js run        # listen + react to events
```

## 6. Deploy the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
# .env.local should have VITE_ETH_HTLC_ESCROW_TESTNET, VITE_API_BASE_URL, etc.
pnpm build
# Serve dist/ via any static host (Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, Netlify).
```

## Verifying contracts on Etherscan

```bash
cd contracts
pnpm exec hardhat verify --network sepolia <ESCROW_ADDRESS> <REGISTRY_ADDRESS> <MIN_SAFETY_DEPOSIT>
pnpm exec hardhat verify --network sepolia <REGISTRY_ADDRESS> <STAKE_ASSET> <MIN_STAKE> <SLASH_BENEFICIARY> <OWNER>
```

## Mainnet rollout checklist

Before flipping `NETWORK_MODE=mainnet`:

- [ ] Both HTLC contracts independently audited (see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md))
- [ ] `ResolverRegistry.owner` transferred to a 2/3 multisig
- [ ] At least 3 community resolvers registered
- [ ] Coordinator behind a CDN / WAF
- [ ] Public bug bounty announced
- [ ] Sepolia run with $1k+ in TVL for a continuous 14-day window without incidents

## Rolling back

If a serious bug is found post-launch, the HTLCEscrow contract has
**no kill switch** by design — this is a feature, not a missing
mitigation. The recovery path is:

1. Stop the coordinator so new orders are not created.
2. Let in-flight orders settle via claim or refund within their
   existing timelocks.
3. Migrate users to a new HTLCEscrow + ResolverRegistry deployment.

This is the same recovery model as 1inch Fusion+ and other HTLC bridges.
