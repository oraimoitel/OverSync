# OverSync — Review Feedback Response

This document is OverSync's point-by-point response to the v1 review
feedback. Every claim below links to source code or test output so
reviewers can verify it independently.

---

## 1. *"Single relayer = single point of failure"*

**Response.** We restructured the operator model around an open
on-chain resolver registry; the reference coordinator is now one
participant, not a privileged operator.

**Evidence.**

- Solidity registry: [`contracts/contracts/v2/ResolverRegistry.sol`](../contracts/contracts/v2/ResolverRegistry.sol) — anyone can stake; misbehaviour is slashable by the registry owner (intended to become a multisig before mainnet).
- Soroban registry: [`soroban/contracts/resolver-registry/src/lib.rs`](../soroban/contracts/resolver-registry/src/lib.rs).
- Resolver runner: [`resolver/`](../resolver/), Docker image: [`resolver/Dockerfile`](../resolver/Dockerfile), guide: [`docs/RESOLVERS.md`](RESOLVERS.md).
- The HTLC contracts have **no admin escape hatch** — verified by the test `non-custodial guarantees > contract has no admin escape hatch` in [`contracts/test/v2/HTLCEscrow.test.ts`](../contracts/test/v2/HTLCEscrow.test.ts).
- Full trust analysis: [`docs/TRUST_MODEL.md`](TRUST_MODEL.md).

## 2. *"Stellar side uses claimable balances, not a real HTLC"*

**Response.** We wrote a native Soroban HTLC contract in Rust. The
contract enforces sha256 hashlock + ledger-timestamp timelock; refunds
are permissionless after expiry. The v1 claimable-balance
implementation in `stellar/src/claimable-balance.ts` is deprecated and
will be removed once v2 reaches feature parity.

**Evidence.**

- Source: [`soroban/contracts/htlc/src/lib.rs`](../soroban/contracts/htlc/src/lib.rs)
- Tests: 10 unit tests passing locally (`cargo test --release -p oversync-htlc`):
  - `happy_path_create_and_claim`
  - `refund_after_timeout_pays_refund_address`
  - `claim_with_wrong_preimage_fails`
  - `claim_after_expiry_fails`
  - `double_claim_fails`
  - `refund_after_claim_fails`
  - `timelock_outside_bounds_rejected`
  - `safety_deposit_minimum_enforced`
  - `admin_can_update_min_safety_deposit`
  - `initialise_twice_fails`
- Deploy script: [`soroban/scripts/deploy.sh`](../soroban/scripts/deploy.sh)
- CI build: [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) job `soroban`

## 3. *"Limited Stellar development; no plan to build on Soroban"*

**Response.** The single largest deliverable in v2 is the Soroban
HTLC contract listed above, plus the Soroban-side resolver registry
and a Stellar wallet integration via the SDK
([`packages/sdk/src/soroban/index.ts`](../packages/sdk/src/soroban/index.ts)) that wraps `create_order`, `claim_order` and `refund_order` with type-safe TypeScript and accepts any wallet (Freighter, headless Keypair, WalletConnect) via a `SorobanSigner` callback.

The Soroban-side ledger contains all swap state — there is no
shadow accounting in the coordinator. The coordinator's SQLite cache
is rebuildable from on-chain events.

---

## 4. *"How is this different from Allbridge?"*

**Response.** Two distinct positioning angles, both backed by
code, not marketing:

1. **First native Soroban HTLC bridge for Stellar.** Allbridge and
   similar bridges use a validator-set / multisig committee on the
   Stellar side. OverSync uses a real HTLC contract whose invariants
   are enforced by Soroban WASM, not by a federated committee.
2. **1inch Fusion+ compatible Stellar gateway.** Our EVM-side
   contracts and resolver pattern mirror 1inch's existing Fusion+
   resolver protocol, so EVM resolver operators can integrate
   Stellar with minimal new tooling.

Full comparison: [`docs/DIFFERENTIATION.md`](DIFFERENTIATION.md).

---

## 5. *"Documentation discrepancies, 'December 2025' typo, '99.5% uptime' claim"*

**Response.** All documentation was rewritten from scratch. The three
overlapping deploy guides (`MAINNET_SETUP.md`, `MAINNET_SETUP_UPDATED.md`,
`RATE_LIMIT_FIX.md`) were deleted; their content was consolidated into
[`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md). The corrupted duplicate block
in `env.example` (lines 156-307 of the v1 file) was cleaned up. The
`ARCHITECTURE.md` claims of "production-ready" status and Stellar HTLC
predicates that didn't exist in code were removed; the new
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md) explicitly flags which
components are shipped and which are still in rebuild.

Verifiable uptime / metric claims have been removed pending real
measurements; nothing in the new docs is unsupported by code.

---

## 6. *"Three test transactions failed without refunds being available"*

**Response.** The v1 refund path was mocked
(`relayer/src/recovery-service.ts:364-371` simply logged "refund triggered"
and returned a fake hash). v2 makes refunds **permissionless and direct**:

- On Ethereum: any address can call
  `HTLCEscrow.refundOrder(orderId)` once the timelock has expired.
  Funds always go to `refundAddress`, which the contract pins to the
  original user. Tests:
  - `returns the locked amount to the refund address after timeout, permissionlessly`
  - `rejects refund after a successful claim`
- On Stellar: the Soroban contract's `refund_order` works the same
  way. Tested by `refund_after_timeout_pays_refund_address` and
  `refund_after_claim_fails`.
- The frontend exposes a `RefundDialog`
  ([`frontend/src/features/refund/RefundDialog.tsx`](../frontend/src/features/refund/RefundDialog.tsx))
  that calls `refundOrder` directly from the user's wallet — the
  coordinator is not involved.

A user whose swap fails no longer needs us to act on their behalf;
they recover their own funds via their own wallet.

---

## 7. *"Fake `0x1234567890abcdef` style transactions in history"*

**Response.** All fake / mock data channels were removed in Phase 0 of
the rebuild. Concretely:

- `frontend/src/components/TransactionHistory.tsx` no longer has any
  `mockTransactions` array. It pulls history from `GET
  /api/orders/history` on the coordinator and from real on-chain
  events, and filters out any persisted entry that matches the
  hard-coded list of v1 fake hashes
  (`isRealHash` / `isRealTransaction` helpers).
- `relayer/src/index.ts` no longer returns
  `mock_stellar_${Date.now()}` on Stellar submission failures — it
  returns a real `502` error with a refund hint.
- The v1 `relayer/src/rpc-methods.ts`, `websocket-server.ts`,
  `phase6-bridge-service.ts`, `ethereum-listener.ts`, and `quoter.ts`
  mock data sources were either removed or replaced with explicit
  "not implemented in this build" errors. The legacy relayer cannot
  fabricate data even if a caller hits a deprecated endpoint.

---

## 8. *"Solo team / sustainability concerns"*

**Response.** Two structural changes address this:

1. **Open resolver protocol.** Anyone can run a resolver via
   [`docs/RESOLVERS.md`](RESOLVERS.md); the operator role is not
   solo-coupled. If the original team disappears, community resolvers
   keep the bridge alive.
2. **CI / tests / docs raise the bus factor.** A new contributor can
   onboard by reading [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md),
   [`docs/TRUST_MODEL.md`](TRUST_MODEL.md), and running `pnpm install
   && pnpm test`. There are now 43 automated tests across four
   languages (Rust, Solidity, TS, Hardhat-TS) in CI.

A formal team expansion is planned post-Tranche 1: funding requests
include a full-time auditor liaison and a contracted Soroban
specialist.

---

## 9. *"Budget items don't match grant guidelines"*

**Response.** The revised budget is below. Numbers are USD.

| Tranche | Deliverable | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Audit preparation | Foundry fuzz + invariant suite; Slither must-not-fail CI gate; differential test harness for both chains | $8,000 |
| 1 — Soroban hardening | Resolver registry binding enforcement; partial-fill support; second round of unit tests; testnet load test | $7,000 |
| 1 — Coordinator productionising | Postgres migration; horizontal scaling test; observability stack | $5,000 |
| 2 — Independent audit | Engage two independent auditors for both HTLC contracts (audit fees paid directly to firms, not grant-funded) | $0 (separate funding) |
| 2 — Bug bounty bootstrap | Initial bug bounty pool | $5,000 |
| 2 — Resolver onboarding | Grants for the first 3 community resolvers (capped per resolver) | $3,000 each = $9,000 |
| 2 — Beta program | Bridge insurance fund (catastrophic event coverage, returned if unused) | $6,000 |

**Total request: $40,000.**

The previous $30,000 ask (Audit Preparation $10K, Testing $10K, Beta
User Program $10K) was too broad and not mapped to deliverables. The
revised structure is tranche-gated, with the second tranche only
released after first-tranche deliverables ship.

## Resubmission positioning

The v1 review was correct: the original build mixed a working demo,
single-relayer custody assumptions, placeholder history data, and
overconfident documentation. The resubmission should therefore be
read as a v2 rebuild, not as a cosmetic update to v1.

What is complete for the resubmission:

- Soroban HTLC contract replaces the Stellar claimable-balance
  custody path for v2 testnet.
- Open resolver registry replaces the single privileged relayer as
  the target operator model.
- Refunds are explicit: on-chain HTLC refund, frontend refund dialog,
  inline XLM refund, and watchdog refund.
- Placeholder transaction history is filtered and no longer presented
  as real activity.
- Uptime, volume, and TVL claims are removed unless they can be
  independently verified.
- Budget is tranche-gated and mapped to concrete engineering
  deliverables.

What remains intentionally unfinished before v2 mainnet:

- v2 is testnet-first. The public frontend is testnet-only
  (`VITE_MAINNET_ENABLED=false`); legacy v1 mainnet code remains in
  the repo but is not exposed in the UI until v2 contracts complete
  hardening and independent audit.
- The legacy claimable-balance implementation remains in the repo only
  for v1 compatibility and historical reference; it is not the v2
  trust model.
- Foundry fuzzing, cross-chain differential tests, Slither
  must-not-fail CI, multisig governance, and public audits are still
  pre-mainnet deliverables.
- Team expansion is planned, not completed. The open resolver network
  lowers operational dependence on the founding developer, but formal
  staffing remains a grant milestone.

Suggested summary for the SCF resubmission:

> After the SCF #40 review, we rebuilt OverSync around a native
> Soroban HTLC, permissionless refunds, and an open resolver model.
> The v2 testnet no longer depends on Stellar claimable-balance custody
> or fabricated history data. We are not asking reviewers to treat v2
> as mainnet-ready: mainnet launch is gated on fuzz/differential tests,
> multisig governance, and independent audits. The grant request funds
> those concrete hardening steps rather than broad "audit preparation"
> or generic beta spend.

## Evidence to attach before final submission

Before submitting, attach real testnet evidence rather than relying on
claims in prose:

- At least one successful ETH→XLM v2 testnet swap with Sepolia
  Etherscan and Stellar Expert links.
- At least one successful XLM→ETH v2 testnet swap with both explorer
  links.
- One failed/expired order recovered through `refundOrder` with the
  refund transaction link.
- One XLM→ETH failure path recovered through the automatic refund or
  watchdog refund, with Stellar Expert link.
- Screenshot or dashboard export showing the coordinator history API
  returning only real transactions.

## Verification commands

A reviewer can verify the claims above with:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @oversync/sdk test           # 8 tests
pnpm --filter @oversync/coordinator test   # 4 tests
pnpm --filter @oversync/contracts compile
pnpm --filter @oversync/contracts exec hardhat test test/v2  # 21 tests
cd soroban && cargo test --release         # 10 tests
```

All 43 tests are expected to pass on a clean checkout of the
`v2-rebuild` branch.
